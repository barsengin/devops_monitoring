# Devops Monitoring

This project is about devops monitoring systems. So, we use prometheus, grafana, node exporter and mysql exporter  docker installations.

# Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source software application used for event monitoring and alerting. It records real-time metrics in a time series database with flexible queries and real-time alerting. A simple user interface where you can visualize, query, and monitor all the metrics.

# Grafana

Grafana is an open-source platform for data visualization, monitoring, and analysis. In Grafana, users can create dashboards with panels representing specific metrics over a set time frame. Grafana supports graphs, tables, heatmap, and free text panels and integration with official and community-built plugins and apps that could be visualized.
